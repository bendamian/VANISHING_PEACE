Vanishing Peace: A Case Study in Public Funds Without Accountability

This repository hosts a comprehensive single-page application (SPA) combining a detailed report and an interactive infographic. It investigates the Centre for Just Peace and Democracy (CJPD), a Swiss-based NGO, and its receipt of UK public funds for peacebuilding during a period of national austerity.

The document highlights significant accountability gaps, a profound lack of transparency (including no legal registration or financial reports), and contrasts CJPD's operations with global best practices for Track II diplomacy.

Key Features:

    Integrated Report & Infographic: Presents a full narrative alongside compelling data visualizations.
    Interactive Charts: Utilizes Chart.js for clear statistical breakdowns of funding and accountability.
    Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing across all devices.

    Critical Analysis: Offers a deep dive into the implications of unchecked public funding in sensitive peacebuilding initiatives.

Explore the project to understand the critical need for transparency and robust oversight in international aid.
